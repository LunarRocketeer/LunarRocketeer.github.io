            <p>While aspects of film, animation, and video editing have always interested me, I began my formal training
                in the prestigious Ballard High School Digital Film Making Program. It was here I wrote, produced, lit,
                edited, puppeteered, and cameod
                in several awarded shorts. Since then, my work has largely been relegated to smaller video-editing projects -
                editing, along side writing, remains among my greatest skills in the field.</p>

                <h1>Rift</h1>
                <h2>2019</h2> 
                <p>Lead screenwriter for Rift, a short film about a woman tasked with the usually benign beuracratic grunt work of some sort of paranormal-investigating government agency.  Created by Team Crab Claw for the 2019 48 Hour Film Project in Seattle.  The prompt for this year was to include a mechanic named Harry or Harriet Biddle, a lanyard, and the following line: "The depth of your ignorance is deep."  
                <br></br>The film I'd say was...loosely based on our script, and is a bit harder to follow.  So if you want a look at my work specifically, I'd reccomend checking out the <a href="docs/RiftScript_2019_7_13.pdf" target="_blank">screenplay itself.</a>  But the film is still pretty to look at, and was the honorable mention for the cinematography award.

                <h1>SARP UW Promotional Videos</h1>
                <h2>2019</h2>
                <p>As part of the Society for Advanced Rocket Propulsion's business team, I was tasked with making two
                    videos - the first was meant to give an overview of what our team is about in order to raise funds,
                    and the second was meant to showcase this year's work at the club's largest event: unveiling. For
                    either of these, I poured through hours of footage (some of it taken myself and some by other
                    members), set up interviews, did voice over, textured, lit and rendered our 3D CAD model, even
                    co-wrote an epic classic rock song! The former video helped secure our funding, and the latter
                    helped us celebrate, at its premiere infront of 300 people.

                <h1>My Bike and Me</h1>
                <h2>2016</h2>
                <p>A 3-person-team Ballard High School documentary that follows the perilous journey of Duncan Star
                    Boszko, as he learns how to ride a bike. Production, editing, and music direction was done by yours
                    truly.  Honestly this film is just a plain old good time, and while there were some serious mistakes with the audio I still highly reccomend you give it a watchthrough.
                    <br></br>Admitted to the National Film Festival for Talented Youth in 2017, and shown partially on
                    local news in order to promote said festival.</p>

                <h1>Comeback</h1>
                <h2>2016</h2>
                <p>A young soccer star has to come to terms with her new reality in this Ballard High School short.
                    Primarily worked on editing/effects and audio, but also did a good bit of the story boarding, and am still particularly proud of some of the cool shots and visuals I helped to come up with during that process.
                    <br></br>
                    Won 4 regional Emmy's (for writing, audio, photo/editing, and for Best Short Form Fiction) and 1
                    National (for Audio), as well as admittance to the All American Film Festival in New York City and
                    Fresh Film Northwest in Portland. These and a few other accolades are listed in the description of
                    the linked YouTube video.

                <h2>2016</h2>
                <p>My sister wrote this double-feature commercial, and I along with one other helped produce it for the
                    client based ad unit at Ballard High School. The main allure: puppets! I recall watching The
                    Labrynth one time, and in an interview on the DVD Jim Henson states that everyone knows to never
                    film with babies, animals, or puppets. Well, we hit two of those checks on this shoot, and that
                    brings with it a whole set of new challenges. Beyond making the puppets themselves, making the
                    props, finding enough hands to control them all, and building and lighting the set are all new
                    things we were not used to after a career of filming our usual real world! Although these ads didn't
                    win any awards, we tried something new, and I for one learned a lot.</p>

                <h1>Travels With Cameron</h1>
                <h2>2016</h2>
                <p>This is far less proffessional than most of the films here, but the allowance to be unproffessional
                    is a liberating one. Anything is possible! I wrote and and produced this video largely by myself for
                    my Japanese class. Telling an original and still entertaining story in a language you barely have a
                    basic grasp on is no easy task, although it is easier when you have a language prodigy sister to
                    help. Travels with Cameron stars me, Cameron, as I show off my school and city to the then incoming
                    Japanese exchange students, along side a host of ecclectic characters and some nice 80's/90's
                    aesthetics. Warning, while the blown out audio adds to the experience, it is a bit loud, so turn
                    down your speakers if you watch this!</p>

                <h2>2015</h2>
                <p>During the leadup to the 2016 elections, Bernie Sanders was having a rally right in my own backyard.
                    I set out to gain press access to the rally and was graciously granted it. My high school film
                    teacher lent me the gear, allowing a friend and I to join the rest of the proffessional film crews up on
                    the press stage. It was certainly an exciting experience, and while I went in unsure as to what I
                    would use this footage for or if I'd even be allowed to get it, I learned that sometimes you just
                    have to jump in and go for it.<br></br>Unfortunately they played a copywritten song at the end of
                    the rally, so the entire YouTube video has since been blocked. That seems fair.  A screenshot is included instead.</p>

                    storyboarding and was primarily responsible for lighting and editing.  Music and some of the audio engineering was also done by me.

                <h2>2015</h2>
                <p>An ad I wrote to promote Net Neutrality when it first came up for a vote in 2015. We were required,
                    by the school project, to get a client, so I got the very small political group The Futurist Party
                    involved. Really, they had little oversight. I would probably write this a little differently if I
                    were to do it again. I agree with the feedback we got after the ad was nominated for a regional Emmy
                    - they stated the message was a little unclear. I suppose you can be the judge. Another fun thing we
                    did here was design and print several volumes of "Approved Content" - the book that populates a
                    shelf you'll see. I still have one of those covers laying around somewhere.

                <p>Another loud retro video featuring my voice over, this wasn't THE first editing project I ever took,
                    but it was one of the first of any reasonable size and in any still presentable state. I created this for an alternative energy unit
                    in freshman science class, and it taught my many things. First it instilled in me the joy of
                    controlling a visual story without ever picking up the camera myself, and it taught me that a funny
                    video is a super easy way to gain a bit of popularity when you're the new shy kid in class. Both
                    lessons have made me into who I am today.</p>
