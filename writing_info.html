            <p>Writing is a something that's been with me since forever. As early as kindergarden I was being noticed for it, but more importantly I had already started to enjoy it.  Wether it be short stories, school essays, or screenplays, putting pen to paper and finger to keyboard is something that brings me great joy and pride. Sharing my work through spoken word and presentation is something I've started to become good at later in life, but already I think I do a good job at delivering my ideas to a crowd in a clear, interesting, and entertaining way.
            <br></br>
            Since writing comes up in everything I do, this page is kind of just a catch-all for the things that didn't fit elsewhere.  My academic writings, for example, are on the Geography page.  Also, there unfortunately exists few recordings of any of my presentations, so you'll jus thave to take my word for it that I'm really great.

                <h1>After Everything</h1>
                <h2>2020</h2>
                <p>A short story based on the following writing prompt from reddit: You are immortal. After your body can no longer be supported in any form on any planet due to the universe entering the final stages of heat death, you finally understand - you are to become the next "God", due to you existing before the next universe's big bang and being unable to die.
                <br></br>
                Still not sure how I feel about the ending, but I guess the demise of the universe is never going to live up to our expectations, is it?

                <h1>CSE Admission Application Essay</h1>
                <h2>2019</h2>
                <p>While digging around my computer trying to find cool things to list here, I found this essay I wrote back when my biggest goal in life was becoming a big programmer.  I might still do that someday, who knows, but a lot of other things have made it further up the list since then.  Even so, I'm putting this essay here largely for my own benefit.  Honestly, it got me pumped up!  Is it pompous to be inspired by your own writing?  Almost definitely, yes.  But I struggle with self confidence in better times than these, so it's nice to read something so kind about myself from younger Cameron.  I hope he'd be proud.  It's also pretty dang funny, so maybe worth a read if you want to be inspired AND have a good laugh.</p>

                <h1>Graduation Speech</h1>
                <h2>2016</h2>
                <p>My final two years of high school were when I started to actually enjoy public speaking and presenting.
                    Despite the near panic-attack state I sometimes enter prior, sharing my thoughts with others, either
                    to simply explain or to open myself up to improvement, is something I began having a lot of fun
                    with! So when it came time to have auditions for speeches and perforamcnes at our graduation, I knew
                    I had to try my harest to get the spotlight. After some feedback from my English teacher, I went up
                    on the practice stage and delivered my speech, and after some debate from the judges (as I was told later) and some
                    more speech-edits, I
                    managed to get that spotlight. I think the piece lost a bit of focus at the end, it didn't quite hit
                    the resolution that it should have, but the words I delivered that night continue to come to my mind
                    as I keep growing up, and the real end to that speech has really only just begun to reveal itself to
                    me.

                <h1>A Rude Awakening in Space</h1>
                <h2>2015</h2>
                <p>After successfully trying out to be a writer in Ballard High School's 24 hour plays, I spent the
                    better part of a night writing my first play-script about a
                    janitor, doctor, and space captain alone on what might be their final journey abord their starship. I was going to include the video, but it's terrible, shaky footage taken on my old phone.  Can barely see or hear anything other than my chuckles.  I don't know, email me if you want to see it.  Enjoy one of my favorite pictures from the night instead (click it to read the script).</p>

                <h1>Nerds VS Populars</h1>
                <h2>2013</h2>
                <p>A book I self published in middle school via Amazon. It's...about as good as you'd expect a book written by a middle schooler to be. But I will say that the concept is at least a little more novel than the title implies. Following
                    the ridiculous aftermath of a series of fights at Castle Vine Middle School, this e-book is now generously offered to you free of charge (in Word Doc form) from this very website.
