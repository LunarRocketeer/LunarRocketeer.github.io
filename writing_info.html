            <p>Writing is a something that's been with me since forever. As early as kindergarden I was being noticed
                for it, but more importantly I had already started to enjoy it. Wether it be short stories, school
                essays, or screenplays, putting pen to paper and finger to keyboard is something that brings me great
                joy and pride. Sharing my work through spoken word and presentation is something I've started to become
                good at later in life, but already I think I do a good job at delivering my ideas to a crowd in a clear,
                interesting, and entertaining way.</p>

                <h1>Graduation Speech</h1>
                <h2>2016</h2>
                <p>My final year of high school was when I really started to enjoy public speaking and presenting.
                    Despite the near panic-attack state I sometimes enter prior, sharing my thoughts with others, either
                    to simply explain or to open myself up to improvement, is something I began having a lot of fun
                    with! So when it came time to have auditions for speeches and perforamcnes at our graduation, I knew
                    I had to try my harest to get the spotlight. After some feedback from my English teacher, I went up
                    on the practice stage and delivered my speech, and after some debate (as I was told later) and some
                    more edits, I
                    managed to get that spotlight. I think the piece lost a bit of focus at the end, it didn't quite hit
                    the resolution that it should have, but the words I delivered that night continue to come to my mind
                    as I keep growing up, and the real end to that speech has really only just begun to reveal itself to
                    me.

                <h1>A Rude Awakening in Space</h1>
                <h2>2015</h2>
                <p>After successfully trying out to be a writer in Ballard High School's 24 hour plays, I spent the
                    better part of a night writing my first play-script about a
                    janitor, doctor, space captain alone on what might be their final journey abord their starship. </p>

                <h1>Nerds VS Populars</h1>
                <h2>2013</h2>
                <p>A book I self published in middle school via Amazon. It's about as good as you'd expect it to be
                    given my age,
                    but I will say that the concept is at least a little more novel than the title implies. Following
                    the ridiculous aftermath of a series of fights at Castle Vine Middle School, this e-book is now
                    offered to you free of charge from this very website.
